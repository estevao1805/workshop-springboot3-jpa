## About the Project
This project was developed during my studies in java and Spring Framework as an activity proposed during the [java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) taught by professor [NÃ©lio Alves](https://github.com/acenelio).<br>
The application consists of a webservice that provides and manages data from a simple sales system.
